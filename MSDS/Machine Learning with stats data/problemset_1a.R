#Question 2: Data Visualization
###############################################################################
#Question 2.1: Visualization Basics
###############################################################################
library(ggplot2)
# 1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see and why?
ggplot(data = mpg)

# Answer: It just creates the background of the plot, because we have to use 
# the geom function and specify the layers for it to work correctly.

# 2. What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.
?mpg
# Answer: It describes the type of drive, it has 3 categories:
# f = front wheel drive
# r = rear wheel drive
# 4 = 4 wheel drive

# 3. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = drv)) + geom_point()

# Answer: This code gives a non-useful plot, there are two reasons for that, the first
# is both of them are categorical variables and scatterplots are usually good for continuous
# variables. The second point is that there are limited amount of categories in both
# drv and class variable and many points will overlap.

###############################################################################
# Question 2.2: Aesthetic Mappings
###############################################################################
# 1. Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))

# Answer: The issue with the code is the placement of the color aesthetic. 
# When you place the color = "blue" inside the aes() function, you're essentially telling
# ggplot2 to create a color mapping based on a constant value "blue",
# not to color the points blue.
# The correct code is:
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue") # color is outside aes


# 2. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type
# ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information
# when you run mpg?

# Answer: Categorical variables in the mpg dataset are: 
# manufacturer model trans (transmission type) 
# drv (type of drive train) 
# fl (fuel type) 
# class (class of car)
# To see the structure of the mpg dataset in R, including the types of each variable, 
# we can use the str()
str(mpg)

# 3. Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave
# differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

# Answer: Mapping to color:
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = cty, color = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

# For a continuous variable mapped to color: A color gradient is used. 
# By default, low values are mapped to one end of the color spectrum 
# and high values to the other end (often red).

# Mapping to size:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = cty, size = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
# For a continuous variable mapped to size:
# Point sizes vary continuously based on the values of the variable.
# Larger sizes correspond to higher values, and smaller sizes correspond to lower values.

# Mapping to shape:
#ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = cty, shape = hwy)) +
#  geom_point()

# shows an error because shape cannot handle a continuous scale by default. 

# 4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?
# Answer: 
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = cty, color = hwy, size = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

# This can tell the trends in the data but can also make the plot more complex 
# and harder to interpret.

###############################################################################
# Question 2.3: Facets
###############################################################################

# 1. What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?

# Answer: When we facet on a continuous variable, the variable's range gets split into 
# intervals, and a separate plot is created for each interval. The continuous variable 
# is converted to a categorical variable, and the plot contains a facet for each distinct value.

# 2. What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do they
# relate to this plot?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)

# Answer: When we use facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) with the mpg dataset, we creating a matrix 
# of plots where the rows represent the unique values of the drv variable 
# and the columns represent the unique values of the cyl variable.
# The empty cells in this facet plot represent combinations of drv and cyl for which 
# there are no observations in the mpg dataset. 

# 3. Take the following faceted plot:

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)

# What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are
# the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?

# Answer: 
# Advantages: It breaks the data into multiple smaller plots based 
# on a categorical variable this allows us to easily compare patterns 
# within each subset of data without overlap. In colors, it is difficult to distinguish properly.
# Also, with a large number of categories, color can become hard to read. 
# Faceting distinguishes between groups better.
# Disadvantages: Consumes more space, Harder to compare points between different categories.

# Question 2.4: Geometric Objects
###############################################################################

# 1. What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area chart?

# Answer: 
# line chart: geom_line()
# boxplot: geom_boxplot()
# histogram: geom_histogram()
# area chart: geom_area()




# 2. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# Answer: Both the graphs will do the same thing and will look the same.
# The only difference is in the code structure.
# In the first code, aesthetic is defined globally and 
# both the geom_point() and geom_smooth()
# will inherit these global settings.
# In the second code, the aesthetic is defined locally 
# for both geom_point() and geom_smooth()
# Thus, both these codes give the same output graphs.

# Question 3

#An interesting data set we came across was the General Social Survey (GSS)
#dataset. It is a high-quality survey which gathers data on American society
#and opinions, and it conducted since 1972. The data set can be accessed in
#R using the library infer. The dataset present in R is a sample of the
#original dataset of 500 entries from the original with a span of years
#1973-2018. It includes demographic markers and some economic variables.
#It contains of 11 variables namely year (year the respondent was surveyed),
#age (age of the respondent at the time of the survey), sex (gender of the
#respondent which is self-identified by them), college 
#(whether the respondent has a valid college degree or no),
#partyid (respondents political party affiliation), 
#hompop (number of people in the respondents house), 
#hours (number of hours the respondent works while he was being surveyed),
#income (total family income of the respondent), class 
#(subjective socioeconomic class identification), finrela 
#(opinion of family income) and weight (survey weight). The data set consists 
#of just 500 rows of data.
#We can use this dataset to generate the average number of people living
#in each household in a certain year. We can chart out the slope of the '
#increase or the decrease in the number of people in each household. 
#We can determine how much an average worker works each week and 
#the average salary they get for each hour. We can group the previous
#result based on the class of the individual. We can determine which political
#party is likely to succeed in that area during a specific year. The literacy 
#rate of the area can be determined on whether a person has achieved a degree 
#or not. Many such inferences can be made through this dataset by various 
#statistical methods. We can group the dataset based upon the years by 
#splitting the dataset and can determine many inferences according to the year. 
#Same can be done by splitting the dataset by class or political party
#preferences.
